# java-collada
Parses COLLADA files. Best served cold.

This has mostly been just a personal project with no original intention to publish. Eventually I figured I might as well put up what I have than let it gather byte-dust.

Requires JeXiMeL, my XML tool.

Loads .dae files.

By the way, it doesn't implement the entire COLLADA spec. It was made to support version 1.4 specifically, but it might work with other versions, who knows. Forget about lights and scenes, this is for vertices (indexed), texture co-ordinates, normals and tangents.

Thas it mayne.
